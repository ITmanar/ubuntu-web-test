# ubuntu-web-test
This is a simple university project I created for the System Administration and Maintenance course. The goal was to install and configure the Apache web server on a Linux (Ubuntu) system. The project includes basic server setup, configuration file editing, and testing the server locally using the browser.

Itâ€™s a beginner-level project that helped me understand how web servers work and how to manage them in a Linux environment.
